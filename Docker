# Use the official Nginx image as a base image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the static website files to the Nginx HTML directory
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to the outside world
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]


# .dockerignore
# Create a .dockerignore file in the root directory to prevent unnecessary files from being copied into the Docker image:

# Dockerfile
# .dockerignore
# Build and Run the Docker Container
# Follow these steps to build and run the Docker container:

# Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.

# Build the Docker image:

# docker build -t deesdaycare .
# Run the Docker container:

# docker run -d -p 8080:80 deesdaycare
# Your static website should now be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

# Explanation
# FROM nginx:alpine: Uses the official Nginx image based on Alpine Linux, which is lightweight.
# COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html: Copies all the files from your current directory (where index.html and styles.css are located) to the Nginx HTML directory.
# EXPOSE 80: Exposes port 80, which is the default port that Nginx listens to.
# CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]: Starts Nginx in the foreground (daemon off) to keep the container running.
